**Policy on Personal Information**

The new General Data Protection Regulation came into force on 25 May 2018 requiring us to confirm with members how we handle the data which is provided to us.

Chantry Community Association holds a limited amount of members’ personal data, typically name,address and in many cases an email address, plus an age identifier for concession entitlement. We only hold this data in order to communicate with members on matters relevant to our activities as a residents' association and to manage subscriptions. These details are kept securely and we undertake not to sell or provide this data to any third party. We undertake not to use it to cause members any inconvenience or annoyance, for instance by promoting any third party goods or services. We undertake to delete any or all of a member’s data immediately on request. We will remind members of these undertakings, and give members an opportunity to update or correct their data, on an annual basis. Members can at any time ask to see what data we hold.

**How we document our data**

- The present Data Protection Officer (DPO) is Susan Haddock.
- Members’ data consists of name, address, email (some) and age identifier (senior citizens have a concessionary subscription rate).
- The original address lists were derived from our collector/deliverers.
- The lists are maintained by the DPO and are updated on an annual basis from feedback by deliverers/collectors.
- The complete list is available only to the DPO unless other committee members need access to assist in the annual subscription collection process.
- The individual street lists are available to the designated deliverers/collectors in order for them to carry out their duties. They may elicit email addresses from members in order to facilitate communication.
- The complete list is maintained on a computer by the DPO and is password protected. A regular back-up is made.
- Deliverers/collectors are required to return their street lists to the DPO or to shred them when finished with.
- Every reasonable effort is made to protect the data collected.
